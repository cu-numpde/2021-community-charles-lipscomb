### Install and run

Check the following boxes when complete or add a note below if you
encountered a problem.

- [ ] The test suite passes

### Notes/concerns/risks
I've encountered a problem! When I attempt to install the dependencies I get the error: 'No output from Fortran test program'. Googling the problem has not reaped any sufficient fixes. I'm very interested in their PIC implementation and their use of parallelization so I'd really like to get this working but am feeling a bit stuck.
